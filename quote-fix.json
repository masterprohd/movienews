I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I always hate nice girls."

However, whoever you might be, without choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the world's wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they can't help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful... Yes, at least, to the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness. "

Actually, you shouldn't even think that you've figured out another species based on your standards. I think it's human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a \"friend\" to man. Still, even if we can't comprehend them, they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We protect the environment because humans themselves don't want to go extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think that's fine, and that it's really all there is to it. There's no point in despising humans by human standards. That's right. So in the end, it's hypocritical for us to love Earth without loving ourselves.\n"

The human species can't use magic and can't even perceive it—but because we are weak, we have the wisdom to run away from magic and the intelligence to see through it! We don't have any extraordinary senses. But because we are weak, by learning and gaining experience, we gained the wisdom to achieve the unachievable—to predict the future...Rejoice! We are humans; we are the most talented people! Precisely because we were born without any ability, we can achieve anything. This is the will of the weakest race!"

Somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights, so we do still fall to the ground every now and then. So learn here. You can go on to school once you have a game plan. That's my secret lesson, from me to you."
